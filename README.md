# @dprint/node-plugin-base

**DO NOT USE: I have not even tried running this code yet. Also, dprint does not support Node plugins at the moment (see issue below)**

Common code that can be used to create a Node-based dprint formatting plugin.

Note: Follow https://github.com/dprint/dprint/issues/702 for updates on Node
